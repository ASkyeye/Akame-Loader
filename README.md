<h4 align="center">An open source, UD shellcode loader written in C++17</h4>

## Details


## VirusTotal Scan (3/71 security vendors and no sandboxes flagged my meterpreter as malicious)
I uploaded the loader to Virus Total because I don't want this to be used for malicious purposes!
The shellcode used was generated by metasploit (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) and encrypted by \resources\encrypt.exe
The loader was build with VS22 and signed with a sha1 certificate
